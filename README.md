## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v1.x or v3.x)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (locally or via a cloud provider like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas))

---

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NextCoreDev/shty.me.git
   cd shty.me
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

---

### Development

1. Locate the `.env.example` file in the root directory.
2. Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:

```bash
 cp .env.example .env
```

3. Open the .env file in your preferred text editor and update the placeholder values with your actual configuration values. For example:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://DATABASE_USER:DATABASE_PASSWORD@DATABASE_URL/DATABASE_NAME
PORT=PORT_NUMBER
NODE_ENV=development / production
```

To start the development environment for web:

```bash
yarn run dev
```

This will start the `web` app at `http://localhost:3000`.

To start the development environment for native (via Expo):

```bash
cd apps/native
expo start
```

---

### Build

To build the project for production:

```bash
yarn run build
```

This will build all apps and packages in the monorepo.

---

## üåü Features in Development

- **Statistics Dashboard**: A web-based dashboard to analyze URL performance.
- **Custom URL Aliases**: Allow users to create custom short links.
- **Mobile App**: A fully functional app for shortening and managing URLs on the go.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Code Quality

The project uses the following tools to maintain high code quality:

- **Prettier**: Automatic code formatting. Run `yarn prettier` to format code.
- **ESLint**: Static code analysis. Run `yarn lint` to check for linting errors.
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking. Run `yarn tsc` to check for type errors. test
